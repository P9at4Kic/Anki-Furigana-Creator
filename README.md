# Anki Furigana Creator

An add-on for Anki to generate furigana on demand during Japanese vocabulary card creation

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and add it to your Anki 2.1 addons folder, or alternatively download a package of the add-on from https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/165386676

The way to use is the following:

1. The user types vocabulary or sentence e.g. "振り仮名" in a field.
2. The user selects the word he wants to add the furigana to (here the word "振り仮名"). The user press the Furigana Creator button, or press the shortkey set in the configuration.
3. The field becomes "振[ふ]り 仮[が] 名[な]".

The button icon is a "き" in the editor, and the default hotkey is ctrl+1.

## Built With

This addon relies on jisho.org to place the kana on top of the right kanji. Maybe there is a better way. Don't hesitate to suggest improvements.
